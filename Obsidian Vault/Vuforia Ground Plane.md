"Ground Plane uses only the surrounding environment to detect, augment, and track content. All that is needed is a supported environment and a supported device to enable the Anchor ObserverÂ and Device Pose Observer capabilities." ~ Vuforia Docs

Documentation found [here](https://library.vuforia.com/environments/ground-plane).

In the context of the application, the ground plane is used simply as a means for vuforia engine to continue rendering the 3d objects even after losing track of all [[Vuforia Image Target]]s.
